<p>KDE is happy to announce that we will be part of <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/27/google-summer-code-2019">Google Summer of Code 2019</a>. GSoC is a program where students recieve stipends to work on free software for 3 months. Getting paid for open source work, that&#8217;s the dream, right?</p>



<p>KDE Connect is participating with 3 interesting projects that also involve other areas of KDE</p>



<h3>1. Improving KDE Connect on Windows</h3>



<p>KDE Connect builds and runs on Windows, but there are a lot of things that can be improved. This mostly involves the functionality that makes use of notifications. A large part of this task is about improving KNotifications on Windows. </p>



<h3>2. An SMS app for Plasma Mobile</h3>



<p>Plasma Mobile does not have a functional SMS app yet. We believe that the best way to create one is to reuse the SMS UI we&#8217;ve been developing for KDE Connect. We verified that the Plasma Mobile SMS stack is functional on the Nexus 5 (I have no information about other devices). The UI is already running on a phone, what&#8217;s missing is a backend that talks to ofono</p>



<h3>3. Barcode scanning infrastructure</h3>



<p>Scanning a barcode is one of those tasks that comes up in various different apps but the developers don&#8217;t want to implement it themselves. For those kind of tasks we have the <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/purpose/html/">Purpose framework</a> in KDE. It allows the developer to specify a desired action and let the user choose from available services to fulfil them. E.g. the Share feature in Dolphin is implemented via Purpose. This task is about adding a new action type to Purpose that allows to scan a barcode. Possible implementations could use the local camera or the camera of a device connected via KDE Connect.</p>



<p>If you are interested in doing one of those tasks and have some basic understanding of C++ please contact us on #kdeconnect on Freenode or on <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/BRUUN0bwMhNfn8FIejA-nw">Telegram</a>. </p>



<p>The deadline for student applications is April 9th and composing a good application takes some time, so please contact us rather soon.</p>



<p>Please note that we require students to have done some minor work (e.g bug fixes) before starting GSoC. Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t have done anything yet, there is still time for it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Happy hacking!</p>
