<p>Since a few months KDE Connect has a <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/BRUUN0bwMhNfn8FIejA-nw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram group</a> to discuss development. Since the over 100 people joined. I did not expect such an interest in it. Few people asked to have this group bridged to an IRC channel since they prefer IRC over Telegram. I&#8217;m happy to announce that we finally made this happen. Let&#8217;s celebrate the birth of #kdeconnect on Freenode. You can also access it from matrix.org (#freenode_#kdeconnect:matrix.org).</p>
<p>The rest is up to you! If you are interested in contributing to KDE Connect go and share your ideas with us and ask any question you have!</p>
