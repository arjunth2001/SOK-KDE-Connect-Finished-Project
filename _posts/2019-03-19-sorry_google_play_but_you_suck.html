<p>This morning I woke up to the news, that instead of getting a new version of KDE Connect app, it had been removed from the Play store!  The following is a tweet from the lead KDE Connect developer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">KDE Connect has been removed from <a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GooglePlay</a> for violating their new policy on apps that access SMS [1]. The policy has an explicit exception for companion apps (like KDE Connect), but it was removed anyway and *there&#39;s no way to talk to Google*. 1/N<br><br>[1] <a href="https://t.co/WDXEqTUhHl">https://t.co/WDXEqTUhHl</a></p>&mdash; Albert Vaca Cintora (@albertvaka) <a href="https://twitter.com/albertvaka/status/1107924633750253568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Unfortunately, this means that the SMS functionally has had to be stripped out, all because Google Play don&#8217;t understand that this is core functionality for many users (me included).  Their decision to suddenly revoke the exception is, in my opinion, very unfair and not very &#8220;open&#8221; of them.  At least tell us why KDE Connect suddenly violates their policy.</p>
